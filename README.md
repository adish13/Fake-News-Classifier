# Fake-News-Classification
Content based Fake news classification in PyTorch using LSTM
## Description
* Used **Recurrent Neural Networks** with **LSTM** architecture for binary classification of a real/fake news based on its content. 
* Used 200-dimensional glove data for word embeddings and the model architecture consists of the leading embedding layer, 1 LSTM layer, 2 Linear layers followed by a dropout layer

Using 1000 samples :

**Training Accuracy = 86.43%**

**Test Accuracy = 85.84%** 
### Getting Started
Run the notebook in Google colab and add the unzipped dataset files in the realtime data. It might take some time to train the model
